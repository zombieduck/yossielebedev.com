A jury that has opinions or personal thoughts about the defendant or the defence attorney cannot be trusted to make a fair decision. The cartoon shows the jury googling the defence, which creates strongly biased opinions in their minds. This results in an unfair trial.</p>

On the wall, he has tallied 1240 days. That's almost three and a half years that he's been waiting for a trial. Not exactly speedy, is it? To most people that isn't considered speedy. However it is considered speedy when compared to how long it was before the 6th Amendment, it is a very fast trial, and that is what the government wants.</p>

            <h2 class=' fadeInBlock'>History Of The 6th Amendment:</h2>
            <p class=' fadeInBlock'>When the Constitution was signed on 17 September 1787, it was missing a few important sections. More specifically citizen rights. So just two years later on 25 September 1789, a group of twelve amendments were proposed that were entirely about the rights of American citizens. One of those amendments, The right to speedy public trial by an unbiased jury, have witnesses, and counsel. It is better known today as the 6th amendment. The 6th amendment was introduced to organise the judicial system in America, and make court ruling much fairer and thought through. It was to make the court system in America similar to that of the British, which had a magistrate[police] force that questioned witnesses and gathered evidence, and judges that lead investigations. </p>
            <p class=' fadeInBlock'>The 6th amendment took valuable key points from the 1215 English Magna Carta, specifically the right to a speedy and public trial by an impartial jury. At the time there were no professional police forces, public prosecutors or lawyers. The victim and defendant brought their own witnesses and evidence, and it was a long argument that typically ended the same day with the decision of the twelve local citizens serving on the jury. The 6th amendment introduced better police, public prosecutors that represented the victims in court, and lawyers. The amendment also resulted in more witnesses, better witnesses, and more thorough investigations, which lead to a more fair and civilised trial. Trials were publicly held by a well-informed jury from the district in which the crime was committed. The amendment was ratified along with nine others, two of the proposed changes didn’t make it, in a document commonly known as the Bill Of Rights on 15 December 1791 by ten of thirteen states.</p>

                    <p>This graph shows the average wait time for murder and attempted murder trials in New York City 2011. The graph shows that the average wait time for a trial is OVER 2 YEARS. That is not exactly speedy. Of course, it’s not as long as some other countries, which can hold their convicts in prison for decades without trial. "Speedy and Public Trial" to most people might mean a couple of months, but in government "Speedy" could easily be measured in years.</p>

            <h2 class='fadeInBlock'>Supreme Court Case: Gideon v. Wainwright (1963)</h2>
            <br/>
            <p class='fadeInBlock'>Clarence Earl Gideon was arrested in 1961 and charged with breaking into a pool hall/bar and stealing money from a vending machine. He was put on trial and was denied an appointed lawyer. Representing himself, he was sentenced to five years in prison. In prison, he studied law and filed a habeas corpus petition, a petition to bring a prisoner to court to determine if their imprisonment was legal, to the Florida Supreme Court. They denied his petition claiming that a government-appointed lawyer was only necessary for capital crimes, crimes worthy of the death penalty, usually murders. He appealed to the supreme court, which unanimously ruled that his imprisonment was unconstitutional and that he was to be given another trial with an appointed lawyer.</p>
            <br/>
            <p class='fadeInBlock'>The vote was unanimous [9-0] in favour of Gideon. They concluded that it was unconstitutional because 'in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence'.</p>
            <br/>
            <p class='fadeInBlock'>I completely agree with the ruling of the jury. Gideon's imprisonment was unconstitutional, and he should have been given a lawyer. The 6th amendment says that defendants in all criminal prosecutions, not just in capital cases, have the right to the assistance of counsel.</p>

                <p>The cartoonist wants us to believe that in the modern world it is very difficult to come by an impartial jury. Most people have opinions on a very wide range of different topics. Their views are influenced by the media as well as other people. The media creates strong opinions about topics that can be tough to change. These influences make the jury biased and unfair and can result in an incorrect decision, hence the cartoonist's inclusion of the phrase 'Trial by Error'.</p>

            <h2 class='fadeInBlock'>Organisations: The Sixth Amendment Center:</h2>
            <br/>
            <p class='fadeInBlock'>The Sixth Amendment Center is an organisation that works to ensure that no person serves jail time or prison time without a trial in which they have the assistance of a lawyer and the time, and resources to provide a good defence. Most states do not have the necessary funding to provide well-trained lawyers. Some places cannot provide a defendant with a good lawyer, and sometimes they can’t even provide a lawyer at all. The Sixth Amendment Center assess the public defence systems in various regions. When they identify a lack of resources, they help the state and city courts better distribute resources to create a fairer court system.</p>
            <br/>
            <h3 class='fadeInBlock'>Example:</h3>
            <br/>
            <p class='fadeInBlock'>In a case back in October 2015, the 6AC worked to combat an issue in Utah courts where many defendants, especially those facing misdemeanour charges, were never given a defence attorney due to a lack of resources. The problem is that there are not enough lawyers to help the defendants, and one lawyer may end up working many different court cases. The 6AC has been working to resolve the recurring issues in Utah’s courts.</p>
            <br/>
            <h3 class='fadeInBlock'>My Opinion On Their Work</h3>
            <br/>
            <p class='fadeInBlock'>I think what the Sixth Amendment Center is doing is brilliant. Nobody deserves to be criminalised without a chance to defend themselves. All citizens of the United States should be provided with a defence attorney no matter the crime. I applaud the 6AC's work to prevent unfair trials and repair our heavily damaged court system.</p>
