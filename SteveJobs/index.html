						I'm currently reading the book <u>Steve Jobs</u> by Walter Isaacson and I've created this website to share with others what I have read about. It's a very well written book that tells in great detail the story of Steve Jobs' life as well as the history of his company. If you are interested in knowing more about this peculiar man, or want to dive deeper into the history of Apple, then I highly recommend this book.

						<h4>Would it be better if Steve Jobs was never fired from Apple?</h4>

							<h4>In some ways, yes but overall I think that Steve being fired was a very good learning experience for the company. Apple's
								stock value had been mostly going up but when Steve was fired stocks dropped over 75%, which was very
								influential for Apple. Also, if Steve was never fired Pixar Animation Studios would never have existed.
                                If Steve Jobs wasnâ€™t fired Apple might not even exist today at all.</h4>
